     <p align="center"><b>The Nature of the Hybrid:</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p align="center"><b>Sincerity</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>Candor</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>Boldness</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>and Romance</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p align="center"><b>In the world of the hybrid, there is neither shame nor wrongdoing.</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>The young, beautiful woman with curly hair gazes out the window. Her light-colored eyes do not focus. Her arms wrap gently around her body, stroking up and down. Expectation rests at the bottom of her gaze.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p align="center"><b>“This is a special gift.”</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>The hour hand of the wall clock points to six. Night begins to fall. A small floor lamp glows faintly in the living room. Everything else retreats into darkness, visible only in outline. The curly-haired woman wears a white bathrobe that reaches the floor, glaringly bright. She moves slowly toward the window, her steps ghostlike—swaying, silent.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>She enters the stage. Unties the belt. One hand rests on her shoulder.</i></p>

<p><i>Her gaze drops to the side. The floor lamp casts her profile and eyelashes into shadow,</i></p>

<p><i>along with the steam still rising from her skin after bathing.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>She sweeps both hands back. The robe slides down like a waterfall. Muscle lines extend from collarbone to shoulder to arms. Her chest is bare. Her waist lean. Fingers roam over her body. Suddenly she grips her own throat—holds—then moves gently to knead her breasts. Her lips part.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>A pair of eyes appears behind the blinds. Their owner remains hidden. Only dark pupils turn greedily behind binocular lenses.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>The naked woman’s hand moves down along her sternum, past her navel, to between her legs. Her lower body is blocked by the window ledge. The arm moves back and forth in small motions.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p align="center"><b>“Her gaze is like a lustful snake—insatiable, brazen.”</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>The binoculars are sharp. Inside the small circular frame, her naked body appears. Her chin lifts slowly in rhythm with her arm. Her ribcage expands and contracts.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>The HEAT on her skin.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>The owner of the dark eyes smiles. She holds her breath. Fingers adjust the focus. The field of view expands endlessly. In an instant, the distance between the two buildings collapses to nothing.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>She is now inside her apartment—standing by the sofa, hidden in shadow—watching the curly-haired woman masturbate with a pleased, cold smile.</i></p>

<p><i>Her gaze roams freely over the other’s body. Being on the same side as the floor lamp, she sees the lit skin, the body hair, the muscles, everything the slender figure displays—</i></p>

<p><i>her not-quite-full hips.</i></p>

<p><i>And the thought of other eyes between the buildings—ill-intentioned, vulgar, mischievous, curious, indifferent.</i></p>

<p><i>One pair of eyes. Two. Three. Four. Five, six, seven, eight. So many eyes.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p align="center"><b>“This is the crime of accomplices!”</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>The curly-haired suddenly turns to face her. Her face is deep-set and beautiful. Long curled lashes. Upper lip slightly pouted, forming a charming smile.</i></p>

<p><i>The dark eyes look down at her crotch. She grips her own sex. The shaft is covered by her palm, yet excess remains. She begins stroking again, openly, in front of her.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>The dark eyes gasp. She steps back twice. Her awareness snaps back to her own apartment, behind the concealed blinds. Shock spreads across her babyface.</i></p>

<p><i>She quickly raises the binoculars and peers again.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>As if to make it visible, the curly-haired steps back, exposing more of her body. And indeed, between her legs, that THING is there.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>The babyface lowers the binoculars and paces the bedroom.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p align="center"><b>“Must be insane…”</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>The curly-haired remains immersed. She opens her mouth to moan, closes her eyes to savor it, occasionally glancing out the window before continuing. Her muscles tighten further.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Another pair of dark eyes. Catlike.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>The babyface bites her lower lip. Only after a long pause does she approach the blinds again. She lifts the binoculars.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>The curly-haired lowers her head, wiping her lower abdomen and palms. After a few swipes, she squats. Now she disappears completely from view.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>The window is empty.</i></p>

<p><i>The babyface keeps staring at the empty window.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p align="center"><b>(A light knock at the door)</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Hearing the knock, the curly-haired calmly picks up the robe from the floor, stands, slips it back on, loosely ties the belt, and walks toward the door.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>A trash bin holds several crumpled tissues.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p align="center"><b>“Who's there?”</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>She tilts her head, listening. Nothing.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p align="center"><b>“……”</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>She mutters something under her breath, then suddenly opens the door.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>A cat-eyed girl in a dark plaid shirt stands outside.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>They hold eye contact for a few seconds. Then the cat-eyed lowers her head. Her lips press together, loosen, press again.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p align="center"><b>“My name is Haerin.”</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>After saying this, Haerin freezes.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p align="center"><b>“Danielle.”</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Danielle shrugs, spreads her hands in inquiry. Hailin does not answer, does not enter, simply stands there doing nothing.</i></p>

<p><i>Danielle leaves the door open. She looks Hailin up and down. A small curve forms at the corner of her mouth.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Haerin suddenly looks up, brows knit.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Danielle’s smile meets her gaze. She gestures—please.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p align="center"><b>“…You know what I’m here to say. You know what you did to me. You may not know who I am—but you definitely know who I am…”</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Hearing this makes Danielle pauses, she then steps aside and nods her in. Haerin hesitates, even considers leaving. Danielle raises a finger, swears, speaks at length. They stall at the doorway for a moment before both entering.</i></p>

<p><i>Danielle leads Haerin into the living room, motions for her to sit on the sofa. Hailin sits. Danielle stands before her. The sofa faces the window.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>The curly-haired reappears in the binocular’s circular frame. The lens tracks them, stopping at the sofa. Then another figure enters—well-proportioned, long hair tied back, slightly taller than the curly-haired. She sits. The curly-haired stands before her, her slender back barely blocking the view.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>The babyface pouts.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Wearing a short-sleeved shirt, the babyface directs two workers to carry boxes into the empty apartment. She smiles, sees them out, closes the door, steps around the boxes, hands behind her back, and looks into the bedroom. The bed is bare.</i></p>

<p><i>Sunlight fills the room. She squints. Notices something.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Across the way, in a window, a gleaming ivory back. Curly hair spills down shoulders and spine. Hands brace against the sill.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Her expression shifts. She hurries to the living room, rummages through a small box, retrieves a compact pair of binoculars. Back in the bedroom, she searches for the window.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>An engraved word circles the rim: “pham.”</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Danielle places a hand on Haerin’s head. Haerin lowers her head. Danielle strokes gently. Haerin closes her eyes.</i></p>

<p><i>Haerin’s raised shoulders relax. Her cheek presses into Danielle’s palm. Her nose brushes the skin. She inhales deeply.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p align="center"><b>“Oh… brave little thing. How should I reward you? How would you like to be rewarded?”</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Danielle loosens her belt. The robe falls open from top to bottom. She grabs Haerin’s hand and presses it to her breast. Haerin straightens instantly.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Through the binoculars: the robe hangs open, belt dangling. She pins the other’s left hand to her chest. Panicked, cat-like eyes flicker past. Danielle lowers her head, speaking continuously.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p align="center"><b>“Damn it!”</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>The babyface curses, but does not look away.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p align="center"><b>“How long have you been watching me?”</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Danielle releases the hand, cups Haerin’s face. Haerin gazes up, entranced. Her left hand remains, kneading softly.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Slender fingers slowly contract and release against the breast.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Danielle loops her arms behind Haerin’s neck, holding her head. Curls fall, therefore hide her face.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p align="center"><b>“I… have always been watching.”</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Haerin swallows. Her right hand climbs to the other breast. She squeezes harder. Flesh spills between her fingers. Danielle tightens her hold. Haeirn’s nose nearly touches Danielle’s abdomen.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p align="center"><b>“Are you a demon?”</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Haerin releases the breast and pulls Danielle’s back toward her. Danielle loses balance, falls forward, forced to kneel on the sofa, hands braced on Haerin’s shoulders.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Haerin does not hesitate. She latches onto the trembling nipple. Sucks. Her cheeks hollow slightly. Between sides, she mumbles:</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p align="center"><b>“…Or an angel?”</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Danielle lifts her head, flips her hair back. She straddles Haerin’s legs, chest thrust forward. The robe slips off her shoulders, hanging at her elbows. Haerin holds her waist, pulls her close.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Danielle snaps back, begins unbuttoning Haerin’s shirt—one by one. Halfway through, Haerin gasps and stops her.</i></p>

<p><i>Haerin looks down and raises an eyebrow.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Through the binoculars: the curly-haired flips her hair, stands, throws the robe back onto her shoulders, and leads the half-undressed girl toward the bedroom. The circular frame follows. As she enters, the girl rushes forward, pins her against the doorframe, kisses her. They cling together, stumbling.</i></p>

<p><i>Then the wall blocks the view.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Inside the bedroom, Danielle and Haerin kiss as they strip each other.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Someone’s back hits the light switch.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>The babyface lowers the binoculars regretfully. She exhales, tosses her coat over a chair, walks toward the bedroom.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Kicks off her slippers, stands at the foot of the bed, and falls backw</i></p>

<p><i>thrown onto the bed. Haerin’s face comes close—kissing mouth corner, neck, collarbone, down to the navel—stopping before the erect cock. She looks up. Danielle smiles, gaze drifting to the ceiling.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>The blinding ceiling light.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p align="center"><b>“I’m neither angel nor demon. If must say… just an adventurer?”</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Haerin dips down.</i></p>

<p><i>Danielle looks down, only to see her trembling knees and the fuzzy crown of Haerin’s head.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p align="center"><b>“God…!”</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>The babyface’s hand is inside her pants. Her belt undone, slack on the sheets. Sweat dampens her bangs.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p align="center"><b>“Then call me an adventurer too,”</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Haerin lifts her head. Cat eyes narrow with mischief. Nose and upper lip slick with shine.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p align="center"><b>“…for I’m willing to pay the price.”</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>She crawls forward to kiss Danielle.</i></p>

<p><i>Danielle suddenly flips them, pinning Haerin beneath her. Curls fall by her face. A thumb wipes her mouth hard. Then Danielle kisses her.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p align="center"><b>“It's my turn…”</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>She crawls to the edge, lifts Haerin’s thighs, hooks them over her shoulders. Haerin’s lower body is forced completely airborne. Danielle wets pubic hair fully with the her tongue, then flicks her tongue tip teasingly. Haerin instinctively tries to sink down, but Danielle forces her back up and never stopping her licking and sucking.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Haerin’s head presses deep into the pillow. Her gaze dissolves—pain and pleasure intertwined.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>The ceiling sways, on the verge of collapse. Light expands, stretches endlessly. A white flash. A small black dot appears overhead.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>The ceiling draws closer. The dot sharpens—a hole about a finger wide.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p align="center"><b>“Wanna try something new?”</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Panting, Danielle lowers Haerin, rolls off the bed, kneels by the nightstand, opens the second drawer. Her hand goes in. Her expression then shifts to confusion. She searches thoroughly.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Haerin lies still, chest heaving, watching Danielle silently.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Danielle rummages however there's still nothing. She then opens the first drawer, dumps everything out: blindfold, books, perfume, lipstick, bracelets. Empty. She scratches her head.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p align="center"><b>“I swear it was here…”</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>She searches the room naked. Her erect cock slaps against her abdomen as she moves. Finally, she retrieves a wooden box from the wardrobe.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Haerin props herself up, eyes following.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>The box has metal corners and ornate carvings. A manicured hand opens it. A strap-on dildo rests on silk.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Danielle sets the box down, lifts the device in it, gestures for Haerin to put it on.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p align="center"><b>“Conquer me.”</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Danielle, in an oversized striped suit with her curls pinned up, turns from the street into the apartment building, handbag in hand.</i></p>

<p><i>She pulls open the elevator gate and steps in.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p align="center"><b>“Danielle!”</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>She turns back. A leggy girl runs up smiling, holding something, joins her inside. The gate closes.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>The manicured hand presses five and six.</i></p>

<p><i>The elevator ascends. The girl is half a head taller. Hair loosely braided to one side. Suede fringe jacket, floral square-neck dress, ankle boots. In her arms, a wooden box with metal corners—locked. Feather bracelets and copper bangles ring her wrist.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p align="center"><b>“Someone sent you a package. You weren’t in at that time, so I took it for you. Perfect timing—I ran into you just now. Here.”</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Danielle smiles, accepts the box, dips her head politely. Her gaze flicks to the other’s hand.</i></p>

<p><i>A small cut on the index finger. Already clotted.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p align="center"><b>“You’re too kind, Hyein. I don’t know where else one could find such a generous landlord! You even lowered my rent.”</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Hyein curled her lips and shrugs.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p align="center"><b>“I think I just really like your lifestyle… the previous tenants, they really gave me headaches.”</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>They chat easily as the elevator rises.</i></p>

<p><i>It stops at five.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Danielle, holding the box, bids farewell with a smile. Hyein opens the gate for her. Danielle steps out. The gate closes. Hyein ascends. Her smile fades. She disappears.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Danielle lies prone on the bed. Haerin kneels behind her, gripping her hips, wearing the strap-on, thrusting in and out. In. Out. Veins bulge at her temples.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Looking down into the bedroom, sweat beads along Danielle’s beautiful, smooth back. Her hips shudder with every impact.</i></p>

<p><i>As the dildo thrust in and out, Danielle lay even lower but her butt sticking out even more.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Her impressive thing swayed weakly back and forth between her legs in rhythm with Haerin's assault.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Haerin frees one hand, reaches forward and grips Danielle’s penis. Danielle trembles, curls rubbing unbearably into the pillow.</i></p>

<p><i>Sensing it, Haerin speeds up. Her hand strokes faster. And faster.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>A leather gloved hand knocks at the door.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Haerin arches, one arm locking around Danielle’s waist, kissing her protruding spine.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Knock. Knock. Knock.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Haerin thrusts once. Twice. Three times.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>The knocking soon grows urgent.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Four. Five. Six. Danielle’s back suddenly stiffens.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>The gloved hand stops.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Haerin pants, retreats on her knees. Danielle’s curls spread like seaweed on the white sheets.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>A tear slides from her eye.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Polished leather shoes stomped back and forth on the ground, lingering in front of the door. Walked back and forth.</i></p>

<p><i>Gloved hands rub together, creasing the leather.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p align="center"><b>“Open the door!”</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>The door swings open. Danielle leans against the frame in her robe—hair messy, face flushed, neck with a vivid kiss mark.</i></p>

<p><i>A woman in police uniform stands outside. Shining shoes. Straight trousers. Sidearm under her arm. Hands clasped behind her back.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>The officer’s lower face. She speaks. Thick lips.</i></p>

<p><i>Danielle nodded but held a questioning look.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p align="center"><b>"Madam, you've been reported  for allegedly engaging in group sex. ...Are you crying?"</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Danielle gathers her robe, lifts her chin and squints.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p align="center"><b>“Officer, your name?”</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>A gloved hand presents the open badge. Name: Kim Minji. ID: PN-7042-67. Rank: Inspector. Jurisdiction: Ville-Libre de Nouvelle-Lyon, 7th Arrondissement. A righteous, loyal face shows on the photo.</i></p>

<p><i>Danielle tilts her head. No difference between photo and person.</i></p>

<p><i>She smiles then, tears still glinting in her eyes. Without answering, she turns abruptly, but leaving the door open, walking toward the bedroom.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Leather shoes step over the threshold.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p align="center"><b>“Aren’t you coming in to cuff me?”</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>So Minji walked right into the Door. The floor lamp glows faintly. She removes her cap, holds it in her left hand, loosens her tie with her right.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>A gloved hand rests on the doorknob.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>The door was closed.</i></p>
